# Crystal

Just a few little things to try out [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org).

## Why Crystal?
My main interest in Crystal is that its syntax is Ruby inspired (call me terrible names, but I mostly love Ruby) while compiling down to a single executable. A single static executable is a huge win for deployability (a word I just made up).

We will see how the Community adopts Crystal and what libraries come out for it, which is always the tricky part for languages.
